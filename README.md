## About
<p>
Using the Logistic Regression model made a prediction model that can predict whether the transactions are legit or fraud. With the help of Logistic Regression model, I have trained the model and predicited the outcome. The transaction done by the legit peron and the transaction made by the fraud person is represented with the help of visualization, making use of <b>seaborn, matplotlib</b> a better understanding of dataset has been done.

## Numpy

<p>
NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open source Python library that’s used in almost every field of science and engineering. It’s the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it’s at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems. <b>Numpy</b> users include everyone from beginning coders to experienced researchers doing state-of-the-art scientific and industrial research and development. The NumPy API is used extensively in Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image and most other data science and scientific Python packages.

The NumPy library contains multidimensional array and matrix data structures (you’ll find more information about this in later sections). It provides ndarray, a homogeneous n-dimensional array object, with methods to efficiently operate on it. NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures to Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.

## Pandas

<p>
Pandas is an open-source library that is made mainly for working with relational or labeled data both easily and intuitively. It provides various data structures and operations for manipulating numerical data and time series. This library is built on top of the NumPy library. Pandas is fast and it has high performance & productivity for users

## Sklearn

<p>
Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. This library, which is largely written in Python, is built upon NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.
